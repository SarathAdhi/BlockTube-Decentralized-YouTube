## Problem Statement

Plagiarism is a substantial problem in our online world with video plagiarism on YouTube (reuploads). YouTube's platform is built on user-generated content with over 122 million daily active users, based all over the world. Video plagiarism not only violates the intellectual property rights of the original creator but also poses a threat to the integrity of the online content ecosystem. This may also lead to a dent in the credibility of YouTube as a content-sharing platform with viewers and creators alike subsequently losing trust in the company.

## Solution

To create a website with the help of blockchain technologies and methods which give the original content creator sole ownership of their video and subsequently diminish video plagiarism to a minimum.

We run ADS before every video and provide some funds to the creator from the ADS bid money.

Our proposed site uses blockchain technology to give each video its own unique “block” within the blockchain database and store it in IPFS using hashing, meaning the content creator will be the sole owner of their content and render the blockchain tamperproof.

## Tech Stack

- `Next.js` (Frontend) - It gives us ease of use and is a flexible framework which gave us the building blocks to create our project.

- `Tailwind CSS` (Styling) - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. As time is a constraint in this hackathon, we need to style the website quickly and efficiently, so Tailwind CSS is one of the best options.

- `PrimeReact` (Component Library) - React UI Components which are top-notch quality to help us implement all our UI requirements.

- `Thirdweb` (Web3 Development Framework) - Used to build for web3 with powerful dev tools and managed infrastructure services.

- `HardHat` (Development Environment) - Development environment that facilitates building on Ethereum and helps manage and automate the essential recurring tasks.

- `Polygon Mumbai Testnet` - The Mumbai testnet is the testnet of the Polygon network, which replicates the Polygon mainnet, where we’re deploying all our smart contracts. A benefit of it is the comparatively lower gas fees.

- `MetaMask` (web3 wallet) - Allows us to store, buy, send, convert, and swap crypto tokens. We’ll be using this to showcase the crypto transactions associated with blockchain and our site.

- `Solidity` (Language) - Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We’ll be using it to construct and design our smart contracts.

- `Typescript` (Language) - It is a superset of JavaScript which enables us to add type safety to our project which subsequently improves the developer experience.

## Usage of Blockchain

- Enhanced copyright protection:
  Blockchain technology could be used to create a more secure and efficient copyright protection system for video content. The technology could enable content creators to register their work on the blockchain and prove ownership, making it easier to protect against copyright infringement.

- Content creators can receive direct payment:
  One of the benefits of using blockchain technology is that it enables direct payment between parties without the need for intermediaries. Blockchain technology allows content creators to receive direct payments from viewers without the need for a middleman, such as a payment processor. This could potentially reduce transaction fees and increase revenue for content creators.

- Immutable content history:
  The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that data cannot be easily altered or deleted. This means that video content uploaded to the platform remains immutable and cannot be altered or deleted after upload. This could provide a more trustworthy and transparent platform for content creators and viewers.

- Greater privacy protection:
  A blockchain-technology could offer greater privacy protection to users by storing data in a decentralized and encrypted manner. This could potentially reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure that users have more control over their personal information.
